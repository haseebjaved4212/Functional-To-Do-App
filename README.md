## ✨ How It Works

- **Simulated API:** All task operations (add, edit, complete, delete) are simulated with JavaScript Promises and timeouts to mimic real API calls.
- **Theme Switching:**
    - Click the 🌙/☀️ button in the header to toggle between light and dark mode.
    - Theme preference is saved in `localStorage` and will persist across sessions.
- **Animations:**
    - Adding a task pops it in with an animation.
    - Deleting a task animates it out.
    - Theme and color transitions are smooth and modern.

## 🧩 Customization

- **Change Colors:** Edit CSS variables in the `<style>` section of `index.html` for custom color schemes.
- **Edit Animations:** Tweak the keyframes and animation classes for different effects.
- **API Integration:** Replace the simulated API functions with real API calls for a production-ready app.
